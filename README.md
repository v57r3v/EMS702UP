I)         ASSESSMENT   INSTRUCTIONS
●      Answers should   be written   legibly   by   hand or word-processed. All text, sketches   and   mathematics   should   be   integrated   into   a single document, and submitted   as   a   pdf.
●       Include a cover   page   (first   page), detailing   your   student   number,   and   the   module   code   and   name.
●       If you   have a   DDS   (Disability    Dyslexia Service) cover   sheet,   include   a   scanned   copy   of that   as   the   second   page of your submission
During the assessment
●      Your submission   must   be your own work, and you   must   not   break any   of the   rules   in   theAcademic   Misconduct   Policy.   Do   not collude with others.   Do   not ask anyone else to answer   the   questions   for   you. All such activities are expressively forbidden. You   must answer   questions   entirely   independently.
●       Please   be   aware   that:
1.    All submissions will   be subject   to   inspection   for   plagiarism   and   use   of   external   tutoring   support.   Detection of such activity will constitute   an   assessment   offence
2.    We will viva a   percentage   of   students   after   each   assessment to   discuss   the   answers   they   have   provided   as confirmation this is   your   own   work
●      Any assessment offences will   be   referred to   the Academic   Registrar for   consideration   by the   Chair   of the   Academic   Misconduct   Panel, and   may subsequently   lead to a severe   penalties,   including   expulsion.
●       Please ensure that   you   read the question   rubric   (above)   carefully,   and   answer   all   the   questions   that   you   are expected to.   Make sure   it   is clear which   answer   refers to   which   question.
●       If you answer   more   questions than specified   in the   rubric,   only the   first   answers   up   to   the   number
required will   be   marked.   Ensure you delete anything you do   not   wish   to   be   marked   before   submission.
●      Any   question   regarding the assessment should   be directed to the   QMPlus   module   forum.   We   will   staff   these during   UK working   hours, so you can   always   expect   an   answer within   24   hours   but   may   already         find the answer to your question within the forum   post.   We   will   only   help   with   queries   around   clarity   of the question   paper and will   not   provide any guidance on the   answers.
Submitting the assessment
●      Submit your answer as a   single   pdf   document   using the   submission   point   on the   QMPlus   module   page.   Your filename should   be the   module code   plus your student   number.   Leave yourself   plenty   of time   for      the   upload.
●       In case of difficulties with   the   upload,   please   email   your   submission   to:
[email   protected]c.uk      before the submission deadline,   putting the   module   code   and   your student   number   in the email subject   line.
Question   1A   supervised   learning   approach   based   on   a   stochastict   learning   algorithm   is   proposed   to   predict the taxiing time of arrival aircraft   for an international hub airport.   Due to the   stochastic   nature   of   the   learning   algorithm,   the   proposed   supervised   learning   approach   has   been   trained 20 times   indepently on the same   training   data   and   tested   on   the   testing   data   set   in   order   to   evaluate   the   performance   of   the   proposed   approach.   The   prediction   accuracy   measured by the Mean Absolute   Error (MAE) for the whole testing data set,   in   minutes, are   as follows:
